## RentBillCompiler 

A simple program that manages tenant's bills for the landlord and to aim to automate each tenant's bill according to
fixed variables such as:
- Monthly Rent
- Fixed Water Bill
- Monthly Internet Bill

And then dynamic variables such as:
- Electricity Bill
- Additional Water Bill (If applicable)

These factors will then be added up and then will be billed to the corresponding tenant.
